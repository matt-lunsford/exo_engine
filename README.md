# Welcome to Exo_Engine!

This is an open source game engine I have decided to undertake working on as a part of my undergrad studies for my Computer Science major. This is purely a hobby project that I am doing for fun.

## What is the purpose of Exo_Engine?

Exo_Engine as stated above is a hobby project designed to further my understanding of various aspects of compilers I haven't studied which includes transpilers!
